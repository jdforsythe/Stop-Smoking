<p>Stop Smoking by JDF Software will help you keep track of your progress as you kick the habit. When you first opened the app, it will have
asked you to input your quit date, how many packs you smoked per day, and the average cost of a pack of cigarettes. The app will update
each day with the new numbers.</p>
<p>You can go back to the preferences screen at any time by tapping on the hammer icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. If you
happen to slip up and smoke, simply tap the Oops button at the bottom of the screen to reset the data. When you are done setting the
new numbers, tap "Save Changes", then perform the "back gesture" - touch beneath your screen and swipe your finger to the left. This will
take you back to the main screen.</p>
<p>More features will be coming in future updates. Go to the official JDF Software forum at PreCentral by going to:
http://bit.ly/jdfsoftware-forum and post any questions, comments, or suggestions. I listen to the users! I will do what I can!</p>
<p>Remember to support JDF Software by downloading my other apps. Search JDF in the Palm App Catalog, or visit
